#### Introduction

- Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is a procedure that is specific to a company or organization that describes the activities necessary to complete a particular task
- Can be considered a science and art form
- Three types of documents that should be in an SOP Manual:
  - Policy: Answers *why*
  - SOP: Answers *what, when and why*
  - Work Instructions: Answers *how*

#### A Plan for Writing an SOP

- To develop a plan:
  - Draw a simple flowchart to map activities of procedure from beginning to end
  - Combine closely-related topics so it flows well
  - Revise flowchart to reflect actual number of steps and number each step
