#### Overview

- Introduced in Windows 2000
- Included with most MS Windows Server OS
- Used by variety of Microsoft solutions like Exchange Server and SharePoint server

- Made up of a number of different directory services:
  - AD DS (Active Directory Domain Services)
    - Core AD service used to manage users and resources
  - AD LDS (Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services)
    - Low-overhead version of AD DS for directory-enabled applications
  - AD CS (Active Directory Certificate Services)
    - Issuing and managing digital security certificates
  - AD FS (Active Directory Federation Services)
    - Sharing identity and access management information across organizations and enterprises
  - AD RMS (Active Directory Rights Management Services)
    - Information rights management (controlling access permissions to documents, workbooks, presentations, etc.)

#### Fundamental AD features and capabilities

- Schema
  - Defines the classes of objects and attributes contained in the directory
- Global Catalog
  - Contains detailed information about every object in the directory
- Query and Index Mechanism
  - Allows users, administrators, and applications to efficiently find directory information
- Replication Service
  - Disseminates directory data across the network

#### AD Domain Services

- Primary AD service
- Used to auth users and control access to network resources
- Server running AD DS is called the domain controller (DC)
- Most domain networks have two or more domain controllers for resiliency:
  - Primary
  - Backup

#### AD Data Structures

- Domain
  - Collection of objects (users/devices) that share the same AD database
  - Identified by a DNS name (company.com)
- Tree
  - Collection of one or more domains with a common DNS root name
- Forest
  - Collection of one or more trees that share a common schema, global catalog, and directory config
  - Security boundary for an enterprise network
- OU (Organizational Units) are used to simplify admin and policy management. Easier to delegate control over resources to various admins

#### AD Benefits

- Security
- Extensibility
- Simplicity
- Resiliency

#### Relationship to Azure AD

- Azure is next-generation, cloud-based identity management solution used to control access to SaaS solutions (Office 365), internally developed cloud apps, as well as traditional enterprise applications and other on-premises resources
- CyberArk Identity integrates with both AD and Azure AD
  - Enable Single Sign-On, Multi-Factor Auth, and Lifecycle Management capabilities for users stored in these directories
