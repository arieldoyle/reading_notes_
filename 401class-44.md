# Class 44 Reading Notes

## Exploitation with Metasploit

### Resources

- [What is Metasploit?](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3379117/what-is-metasploit-and-how-to-use-this-popular-hacking-tool.html)

### Metasploit

#### Metasploit defined

- Pen testing framework that makes hacking simple
- Essential tools for many attackers and defenders
- Point Metasploit at target, pick an exploit, what payload to drop, and hit Enter
- The core Metasploit Framework is both free and libre software and comes pre-installed in Kali Linux (BSD-licensed)
- The free version offers only a CLI, but a GUI is offered in the Metasploit Pro Framework

#### Metasploit History

- HD Moore released version 1.0 of Metasploit in 2003 written in Perl
- Rapid7 acquired both Metasploit and Moore in 2009
- Moore left project in 2016

#### How to Use Metasploit

- Pretty much every reconnaissance tool you can think of integrates with Metasploit
- During the information gathering phase of a pentest, integrates seamlessly with Nmap, SNMP scanning and Windows patch enumeration, among others
- Bridge to Nessus, Tenable's vulnerability scanner
- Once you've identified a weakness, hunt through Metasploit's large and extensible database for the exploit that will crack open that chink and get you in
- Like fine wine and cheese, pair the exploit with a payload to suit the task at hand
- Once on a target machine, Metasploit's quiver contains a full suite of post-exploitation tools, including privilege escalation, pass the hash, packet sniffing, screen capture, keyloggers, and pivoting tools. You can also set up a persistent backdoor in case the machine in question gets rebooted
- More and more features are being added to Metasploit every year

#### How to Learn Metasploit

- Many free and cheap resources are available to learn Metasploit
- To start: Download and install Kali, along with a vulnerable VM for target practice
- Offensive Security, the folks who maintain Kali and run the OSCP certification, also offer [Metasploit Unleashed](https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/), a free training course that asks only for a donation to hungry children in Africa in return
- The No Starch [Metasploit book](https://nostarch.com/metasploit) is also an indispensable resource that, like all No Starch Press books, comes with a DRM-free ebook
- The Metasploit project offers [detailed documentation](https://metasploit.help.rapid7.com/docs) and its [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/MetasploitR7) is another good resource for the beginning [penetration tester](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3238128/what-is-ethical-hacking-and-how-to-become-an-ethical-hacker.html)
