#### General

- VirtualBox is a powerful virtualization solution that is flexible and provides a wide range of network settings and configurations
- Each VM can use up to 8 virtual network adapters (NICs)
  - 4 configured in GUI/other 4 configured in VBoxManage moidyvm command
- Port forwarding is a process of intercepting traffic addressed to the appropriate IP address and port in addition to redirecting that traffic to a different IP address and/or port
  - Examples of Port Forwarding: SSH Access / HTTP Access

#### Types of Network Modes

- Not Attached
  - This mode can be useful for testing
- [NAT](https://www.nakivo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/VirtualBox-network-modes-%E2%80%93-how-the-NAT-mode-works.webp)
- [NAT Network](https://www.nakivo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/VirtualBox-network-settings-%E2%80%93-the-NAT-Network-mode.webp)
- [Bridged Adapter](https://www.nakivo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/VirtualBox-network-settings-%E2%80%93-bridged-networking.webp)
  - A VM virtual network adapter uses the host network interface for a network connection
  - Promiscuous mode
    - This mode allows a network adapter to pass all received traffic, no matter to which adapter the traffic is addressed.
      - 3 Modes: Deny/Allow VMs/Allow All
      - Used for Bridged, NAT Network, Internal Network, and Host-Only Adapter
- [Internal Network](https://www.nakivo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/VirtualBox-network-settings-%E2%80%93-using-the-Internal-network-mode-in-a-combination-with-the-NAT-mode.webp)
  - Virtual machines whose adapters are configured to work in the VirtualBox Internal Network mode are connected to an isolated virtual network
- [Host-Only Adapter](https://www.nakivo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/VirtualBox-network-settings-%E2%80%93-VMs-use-the-host-only-network.webp)
  - This network mode is used for communicating between a host and guests. A VM can communicate with other VMs connected to the host-only network, and with the host machine
- Generic Driver
  - This network mode allows you to share the generic network interface. A user can select the appropriate driver to be distributed in an extension pack or be included with VirtualBox
  - Two sub-modes
    - UDP Tunnel: Virtual machines that run on different hosts can communicate transparently by using an existing network infrastructure
    - VDE Networking: Virtual machines can connect to a virtual distributed switch on Linux or FreeBSD hosts. You need to compile VirtualBox from sources to use VDE networking since standard VirtualBox packages donâ€™t include this feature

##### [Comparison of VirtualBox Network Modes](https://www.nakivo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/VirtualBox-network-settings-%E2%80%93-Comparison-of-VirtualBox-Network-Modes.webp)

#### Type of Virtual Adapter Types

- AMD PCnet-PCI II (Am79C970A)
  - This network adapter is based on AMD chip and can be used in many situations
- AMD PCnet-FAST III (Am79C973)
  - This virtualized network adapter is supported by almost all guest operating systems that can run on VirtualBox. GRUB (the boot loader) can use this adapter for network boot. Similarly to the previous network adapter, this one is based AMD chip
- Intel PRO/1000 MT Desktop (82540EM)
  - This adapter works perfectly with Windows Vista and newer Windows versions. The most of Linux distributions support this adapter as well
- Intel PRO/1000 T Server (82543GC)
  - Windows XP recognizes this adapter without installing additional drivers
- Intel PRO/1000 MT Server (82545EM)
  -This adapter model is useful to import OVF templates from other platforms and can facilitate import process
- Paravirtualized Network Adapter (virtio-net) is a special case
  - Instead of virtualizing networking hardware that is supported by most operating systems, a guest operating system must provide a special software interface for virtualized environments. This approach allows you to avoid the complexity of networking hardware emulating and, as a result, can improve network performance
