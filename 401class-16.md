### Capital One Data Breach Lessons Learned

#### Major Financial Institution Data Breach

- One of the most devastating data breaches of all time
- Exposed the personal data of more than 100,000 customers and affected appoximately 100 million individuals in the US and 6 million in Canada
- Data loss of approximately 1 million Social Insurance Numbers of Canadian credit card customers, about 140,000 SSNs, and 80,000 linked bank account numbers of the credit card customers
- Attack occurred due to a misconfiguration error at the application later of a firewall installed by Financial Institution, exacerbated by permissions set by Financial Institution that were likely broader than intended
- After gaining access, an SSRF attack was used to get the data access
- July 29, 2019, FBI arrested Paige A. Thompson (aka "erratic") for allegedly hacking into Financial Institution databased and stealing the data

#### Steps Taken to Attack

- Step 1: Identified and Exploited Misconfigured WAF: [command](http://169.254.169.254/iam/security-credentialsT)
- Step 2: Gain Temporary Credentials: [command](http://169.254.169.254/iam/security-credentials/*****-WAF-Role)
- Step 3: Gain Access to S3 buckets by Calling AWS S3 list and Sync

#### Preventions of Such Attacks

- Reviewallaccesspathsandpermissionsfromhumanidentitiesornon-humanidentities(e.g.,ec2 machine)todatastorages(e.g.,S3buckets). Use Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM)solutions to automate the detection of over-privileged identities and over-exposed data.
- AWS lists a few basics [here.](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/secure-s3-resources/) Zscaler Workload Posture with Cloud Security Posture Management(CSPM) automates 100’s of these policies. It provides security and compliance views across all AWS, including verification of the use of version 2 of the EC2 Metadata service instead of version 1 that would have prevented the compromise of the credentials.
- UseCloudTrail,CloudWatch,and/or AWS lambda services to review and automate specificactions taken on S3 resources.
- Ensure each application, EC2 instance, or auto scaling group has its own IAM role. Do not share roles across unrelated applications.
- Scope the permissions of each role to enable access only to the AWS resources required. The “WAF”role described above did not require access to list S3 buckets “in the normal course of business”(according to the indictment).
- If possible, include a “Condition”statement within the IAM role to scope the access to known IP addresses or VPC endpoints
- Don't allow EC2 instances to have IAM roles that allow attaching or replacing role policies in any production environment.
- Clean up unused cloud resources (especially EC2 instances and S3 buckets)left over from prior development or production debugging efforts.
