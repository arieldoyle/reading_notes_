### Application Threat Modeling

#### Overview of Threat Modeling

- Threat modeling works to identify, communicate, and understand threats and mitigations within the context of protecting something of value
- Structured to represent all information that affects the security of an application (view of the application and its environment through the lens of security)
- Process for capturing, organizing, and analyzing all the information
- Can produce a prioritized list of security improvements to the concept, requirement, design, or implementation of an application
- Can be applied to a wide range of things:
  - Software
  - Applications
  - Systems
  - Networks
  - Distributed Systems
  - Internet of Things (IoT) Devices
  - Business Processes
- Typical Threat Model:
  - Description of the subject to be modeled
  - Assumptions that can be checked or challenged in the future as the threat landscape changes
  - Potential threats to the system
  - Actions that can be taken to mitigate each threat
  - A way of validating the model and threats, and verification of success of actions taken
- 2020: Group of threat modeling practitioners, researchers, and authors got together to write the [Threat Modeling Manifesto](https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/) to "share a distilled version of our collective threat modeling knowledge in a way that should inform, educate, and inspire other practitioners to adopt threat modeling as well as improve security and privacy during developement".
  - Manifesto contains values and principles connected to the practice and adoption of Threat Modeling, as well as identified patterns and anti-patterns to facilitate it.

#### Objectives of Threat Modeling

- Activities for improving security by identifying threats, and then defining countermeasures to prevent, or mitigate the effects of, threats to the system

#### Threat Modeling Across the Lifecycle

- Best applied continuously throughout a software development project
  - Ideally, a high-level threat model should be defined early on in the concept or planning phase, and then refined throughout the lifecycle
  - As more details are added to the system, new attack vectors are created and exposed
  - The ongoing threat modeling process should examine, diagnose, and address these threats
- Updating threat models is advisable after events such as:
  - A new feature is released
  - Security incident occurs
  - Architectural or infrastructure changes

#### Threat Modeling: Four Question Framework

1. What are we working on?
2. What can go wrong?
3. What are we going to do about it?
4. Did we do a good job?

Focuses:
    - Assess Scope:
        - What are we working on?
        - This might be as small as a sprint, or as large as a whole system
    - Identify what can go wrong:
        - This can be as simple as a brainstorm, or as structured as using STRIDE, Kill Chains, or Attack Trees
    - Identify countermeasures or manage risk:
        - Decide what you’re going to do about each threat
        - That might be to implement a mitigation, or to apply the accept/transfer/eliminate approaches of risk management
    - Assess your work:
        - Did you do a good enough job for the system at hand?

#### Benefits

1. Provides a clear “line of sight” across a project that justifies security efforts
2. The threat model allows security decisions to be made  ationally, with all the information on the table
3. The threat modeling process naturally produces an assurance argument that can be used to explain and defend the security of an application
4. An assurance argument starts with a few high level claims, and justifies them with either subclaims or evidence
