#### What is a Domain?

- Domains provide network administrators with a way to manage a large number of PCs and control them from one place
- Domain Controllers (DC) control the domain and the computers on it (one or more servers)
- Domains are genreally made up of PCs on the same local network (VPN or internet allows communication with DC)
- When on a domain, the users do not use local accounts, they use accounts and passwords managed on the DC
- This locks down the PCs for system settings
- When a PC is part of a domain, the organization providing that PC is managing and configuring it remotely. They have control over the PC, not whoever is using it.

#### Is My Computer Part of a Domain?

- Just do this for experience
- Check it by opening the Control Panel > System Security category > System > Workgroup

#### Workgroups vs. Domains

- Workgroups are a group of PCs on the same local network (unlike on a domain)
- No PC on a workgroup has control over any other PC (they are equals) and they do not require passwords
- File and Printer sharing

#### Joinging or Leaving a Domain

- Changing the PC name, domain and workgroup settings allows you to join or leave a domain
- Simply re-install Windows to remove it from the domain
