#### Security Testing Basics

- Software security testing is the process of assessing and testing a system to discover security risks and vulnerabilities of the system and its data
- Common breakout for security testing:
  - Vulnerability Assessment – The system is scanned and analyzed for security issues
  - Penetration Testing – The system undergoes analysis and attack from simulated malicious attackers
  - Runtime Testing – The system undergoes analysis and security testing from an end-user
  - Code Review – The system code undergoes a detailed review and analysis looking specifically for security vulnerabilities
- Risk Assessment is not actually a test, but it the analysis of the perceived severity of different risks and any mitigation steps for those risks
