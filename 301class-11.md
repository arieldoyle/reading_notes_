### NAT Overview

- Process which one or more local IP address is translated into one or more Global IP address and vice versa in order to provide internet access to the local hosts
- Generally operates on a router or firewall
- This is the reason why IPv4 is still functional
- When a packet traverse outside the local (inside) network, then NAT converts that local (private) IP address to a global (public) IP address. When a packet enters the local network, the global (public) IP address is converted to a local (private) IP address
- ICMP host unreachable packet to destination is sent if no addresses are left in the pool
- To avoid reply issues, NAT masks the source port number as well and makes an entry in the NAT table

#### NAT Inside and Outside Addresses

- Inside: Addresses that must be translated
- Outside: Addresses which are not in control of an organization
- [Example](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/stati1c.png)
  - Inside local address – An IP address that is assigned to a host on the Inside (local) network. The address is probably not an IP address assigned by the service provider i.e., these are private IP addresses. This is the inside host seen from the inside network
  - Inside global address – IP address that represents one or more inside local IP addresses to the outside world. This is the inside host as seen from the outside network
  - Outside local address – This is the actual IP address of the destination host in the local network after translation
  - Outside global address – This is the outside host as seen from the outside network. It is the IP address of the outside destination host before translation

#### NAT Configuration Types

- Static NAT:
  - Single unregistered (Private) IP address is mapped with a legally registered (Public) IP address
  - Generally used for Web hosting
  - Not for organization use
- Dynamic NAT:
  - Unregistered IP address is translated into a registered (Public) IP address from a pool of public IP addresses
- Port Address Translation (PAT):
  - Many local (private) IP addresses can be translated to a single registered IP address

#### Advantages of NAT

- NAT conserves legally registered IP addresses
- It provides privacy as the device’s IP address, sending and receiving the traffic, will be hidden
- Eliminates address renumbering when a network evolves

#### Disadvantages of NAT

- Translation results in switching path delays
- Certain applications will not function while NAT is enabled
- Complicates tunneling protocols such as IPsec
- Also, the router being a network layer device, should not tamper with port numbers(transport layer) but it has to do so because of NAT
