### What is a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)?

#### Defined

- VPC: a public cloud offering that lets an enterprise establish its own private cloud-like computing environment on shared public cloud infrastructure
- Gives enterprise the ability to define and control a virtual network that is logically isolated from all other public cloud tenants, creating a private, secur place on the public cloud

#### Features

- Agility
- Availability
- Security
- Affordability

#### Benefits

- Flexible business growth
- Satisfied customers
- Reduced risk across the entire data lifecycle
- More resources to channel toward business innovation

#### Architecture

- Compute
- Storage
- Networking

#### Three-tier Architecture in a VPC

- Web/Presentation Tier: Takes requests form web browsers and presents information created by, or stored within, the other layers to end users
- Application Tier: Houses the business logic and is where most processing takes place
- Database Tier: Comprised of database servers that store the data processed in the application tier

- To create a three-tier application architecture on a VPC:
  - Assign each tier its own subnext, which will give it its own IP address range
  - Each layer is automatically assigned its own unique ACL
- More details on creating this architecture in a VPC [here](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/virtual-private-cloud-the-tech-and-the-test)

#### Security

- Access Control Lists (ACLs)
- Security Groups

#### VPC vs X

- VPC vs VPN:
  - A virtual private network (VPN) makes a connection to the public Internet as secure as a connection to a private network by creating an encrypted tunnel through which the information travels. You can deploy a VPN-as-a-Service (VPNaaS) on your VPC to establish a secure site-to-site communication channel between your VPC and your on-premises environment or other location. Using a VPN, you can connect subnets in multiple VPCs so that they function as if they were on a single network.

- VPC vs Private Cloud
  - Private cloud and virtual private cloud are sometimes—and mistakenly—used interchangeably.  In fact, a virtual private cloud is actually a public cloud offering. A private cloud is a single-tenant cloud environment owned, operated, and managed by the enterprise, and hosted most commonly on-premises or in a dedicated space or facility. By contrast, a VPC is hosted on multi-tenant architecture, but each customer’s data and workloads are logically separate from those of all other tenants. The cloud provider is responsible for ensuring this logical isolation.

- VPC vs Public Cloud
  - A virtual private cloud is a single-tenant concept that gives you the opportunity to create a private space within the public cloud’s architecture. A VPC offers greater security than traditional multi-tenant public cloud offerings but still lets customers take advantage of the high availability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness of the public cloud. In some cases, there may be different ways of how you scale a VPC and a public cloud account. For instance, additional storage volumes may only be available in blocks of a certain size for VPCs. Not all public cloud features are supported in all VPC offerings.
