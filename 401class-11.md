### Is Cybersecurity Automation the Future?

#### What is Cybersecurity Automation?

- Fosters innovation
- Lead to a more resilient organization from a cybersecurity standpoint
- Increases the complexity of an organization's information systems

- New automation practices:
  - SOAR (Security Automation and Orchestration)
    - Purpose-built security tools
    - Orchestrate activities between other security tools
    - Perfomr specific automation activities in response to identified threats
  - RPA (Robotic Process Automation)
    - Broader set of automation tools
    - Allow for a wide variety of processes to be automated

#### Why Cybersecurity Automation?

- Increasing organizational complexity can lead to significant risk if cybersecurity cannot sufficiently manage the changing environment by properly defending, monitoring, and responding to threats
- Help address lean or ill-proportioned cybersecurity teams
- Vital in order to reilably protect your organization and ensure resilience through robust and repeatable processes

#### What is the Benefit of Automation?

- The cybersecurity team can focus on activities that are more complex, critical, technical, and creative work
  - Cyber Hygiene
  - Zero Trust
- The machine can perform the mundane, repeatable work

#### Three Basic Approaches to Successfully Implement Automation Concepts

1. Embed development capabilities in your cybersecurity team. In this way, developers report directly to cyber leadership.
2. Partner cybersecurity with organizational development teams. This allows cybersecurity to leverage the capabilities of organizational development experts.
3. Adopt a hybrid approach. Utilize an internal team for tactical development work and organizational development capabilities for complex integration tasks.
