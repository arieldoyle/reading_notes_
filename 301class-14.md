### Port Scanner

#### General

- Port Scanner: computer program that checks network ports for one of three possible statuses:
  - Open
  - Closed
  - Filtered
- Valuable tools in diagnosing network and connectivity issues
- Attackers can use port scanners to detect possible access points for infiltration and to identify what kinds of devices you are running on the network, like firewalls, proxy servers, or VPN servers

#### How Does a Port Scanner Operate

- Port Scanner sends a network request to connect to a specific TCP/UDP port on a PC
- Records the response
- The statuses gathered helps engineers diagnost network issues or application connectivity issues (attackers can find possible ports to use for infiltration into your network)
- Ports are virtual locations where networking communication starts and ends
  - Two Types: TCP and UDP
    - Well known TCP ports from the IANA Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (the first 1023):
      - FTP (21)
      - HTTP (80)
      - SSH (22)
- 3 types of responses:
  - Open, Accepted: The computer responds and asks if there is anything it can do for you.
  - Closed, Not Listening: The computer responds that “This port is currently in use and unavailable at this time.”
  - Filtered, Dropped, Blocked: The computer doesn’t even bother to respond.
- Occur early in the cyber kill chain (during reconnaisance and intrusion)

#### Nmap

- [Port Scanning Explained](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*L-Xo0rPwxl854n3zDothmw.png)
- Nmap is one of the most popular open-source port scanning tools available:
  - Ping Scan
  - TCP Half Open
  - TCP Connect
  - UDP
  - Stealth Scanning
  - TCP ACK Scan
  - TCP Window Scan
  - -scanflags

#### Port Scanner Detection Methods

- PortSentry
- Scanlogd
