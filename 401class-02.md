### AWS Architecture

- Computer Domain: anything that has CPU and Memory capacity that allows you to run an arbitary piece of code written in a specific programming language

#### [Separation of Duties](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/fc074d501302eb2b93e2554793fcaf50b3bf7291/2018/09/06/Abstraction1-1024x575.png)

- Consumer Space: Managed by the customer
- Provider Space: Managed by AWS

#### [The Different Abstraction Levels](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/fc074d501302eb2b93e2554793fcaf50b3bf7291/2018/09/06/Abstraction2-1024x576.png)

- The higher you go in the abstraction levels, the more the cloud provider can add value and can offload the consumer from non-strategic activities
- Levels of Abstraction (bottom to top):
  - Physical Server
  - VM
  - Container
  - Function

#### [The Instance (or VM) Abstraction](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/fc074d501302eb2b93e2554793fcaf50b3bf7291/2018/09/06/Abstraction3-1024x574.png)

- First abstraction introduced in 2006
- VM: virtualizes a piece of hardware so that you can run dedicated OSs
- AWS EC2: Service that allows AWS customers to launch instances in the cloud
  - Customer responsible of guest OS and above (middleware, applications, etc) and their lifecycle
  - AWS responsible for managing the hardware and the hypervisor including their lifecycle
- Amazon Lightsail: Easiest way to get started with AWS for devs, small businesses, students, and other users who need a simple VPS (Virtual Private Server) solution
  - Lightsail provides devs compute, storage, and networking capacity and capabilities to deploy and manager websites and web application in the cloud

#### [The Container Abstraction](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/fc074d501302eb2b93e2554793fcaf50b3bf7291/2018/09/06/Abstraction4-1024x575.png)

- This example: Control Plan is managed by AWS. Containers data plane is managed by customer
- "new" abstraction that took the industry by storm in the last few years due to [Docker](https://github.com/docker/docker)
- Container: self-contained environment with soft boundaries that includes both your own applications, as well as, the software dependencies to run it
- Container tech virtualizes an OS so that you can run separated applications with different (incompatible) software dependencies
- Usually implemented in two main logical pieces:
  - Control Plane (aka. Container Orchestration Layer): Responsible for exposing the API and interfaces to define, deploy, and lifecycle containers
    - In 2014, Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) was launched: Highly scalable, high performance container management service that supports Docker and elimiates the need for you to install, operate, and scale your own cluster management infrastructor
    - In 2017, Amazon EKS (Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes) was launched. (Based on the open-source containers control plan technology: Kubernetes)

  - Data Plane: Responsible for providing capacity (CPU/Memory/Network/Storage) so that containers can actually run and connect to a network (typically a Linux host)

#### [The Function Abstraction](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/fc074d501302eb2b93e2554793fcaf50b3bf7291/2018/09/06/Abstraction5-1024x574.png)

- In 2014, AWS Lambda was introduced
- Lambda: execution environment that allows an AWS customer to run a single function (aka. Lambda allows you to upload your code and AWS figures out how to run it at scale)
- You do not need to track the status of the physical hosts or the capacity of the fleet, or patch the OS
- Special: Event-driven model because you can invoke Lambda directly or you can trigger a Lambda function upon an event in another AWS service (ex. Amazon S3 upload or Amazon Dynamo DB change)

#### [The Bare Metal Abstraction](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/fc074d501302eb2b93e2554793fcaf50b3bf7291/2018/09/06/Abstraction6-1024x574.png)

- "No abstraction" introduced in 2017 and launched in 2018
- i3.metal: foundational EC2 instance type on top of which VMware created their own VMware Cloud on AWS service

#### [The Full Container Abstraction](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/fc074d501302eb2b93e2554793fcaf50b3bf7291/2018/09/06/Abstraction7-1024x575.png)

- AWS Fargate: Production-grade service that provides compute capacity to AWS containers control planes (AWS manages the data plane while customers manager the control planes)
- EC2 has two launch types:
  - EC2: tasks get deployed on a customer-managed fleet of EC2 instances)
  - Fargate: tasks get deployed on an AWS-managed fleet of EC2 instances

#### [Conclusion](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/fc074d501302eb2b93e2554793fcaf50b3bf7291/2018/09/06/Abstraction8-1024x575.png)

- Customers with a "lift & shift" approach: more askin to consume services on the left-hand side of the slide
- Customers with a more mature cloud native approach: more interested in consuming services on the right-hand side of the slide
- Fargate: ISO, PCI, SOC, and HIPAA compliant: good for audits because you can use the AWS documentation for audits and compliance overviews
