### Threat Hunting

#### Threat Hunting Defined

- Active/proactive activity (Not alert driven or reactive) searching the network for signs of compromise
- Actually going in to see if any the the internal system: Servers, Desktops, Network Hardware, IIoT, BYOD, etc
- Output: Are any of our systems currently compromised?

#### Why is Threat Hunting Needed?

- Reduces the gap between protection failure and response as much as possible
- Two types of security tools:
  - Protection-based: How to keep the bad people out
  - Response-based: How we get the bad people off of our network once they are there
- Historically, the average cost of of recovery: $3.62 Million
- 2019 Verizon Breach Report

#### SQRRL Defined

- From 2015 until early 2018, Sqrrl was a threat hunting platform vendor with an unusually strong focus on teaching the cybersecurity community about threat hunting best practices
- They published some of what are still foundational documents about threat hunting
- 2018: Sqrrl was purchased by AWS
- 2019: Their website went offline, and those foundational documents lost their permanant home on the internet, making them harder to find and to reference in subsequent work
- This website hosts some of those helpful documents

- [Demystifying Threat Hunting Concepts](https://www.threathunting.net/files/Demystifying%20Threat%20Hunting%20Concepts%20_%20Sqrrl.pdf), Josh Liburdi
  - A look at reality behind some hunting concepts that often confuse even experienced hunters, with a special emphasis on the beginning and the end of the hunting process.

- [Huntpedia](https://www.threathunting.net/files/huntpedia.pdf), Richard Bejtlich, Danny Akacki, David Bianco, Tyler Hudak, Scott Roberts, et al.
  - An ebook collection of essays and “how-to” articles on threat hunting. Although it was originally published by a vendor (Sqrrl) that no longer exists, it’s not tied to their product, and is a great reference for both beginners and advanced threat hunters. The first section talks about hunting theory and practice, while the second focuses on providing detailed, concrete examples of actionable hunts.
