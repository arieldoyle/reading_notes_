## Data Loss Prevention and Data Classification

### Resources

- [What is Data Loss Prevention (DLP)?](https://digitalguardian.com/blog/what-data-loss-prevention-dlp-definition-data-loss-prevention)

### Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

#### Defined

- Set of tools and processes used to ensure that sensitive data is not lost, misused, or accessed by unauthorized users
- DLP software classifies regulated, confidential, and business critical data and identifies violations of policies defined by organizations or within a predefined policy pack
- Driven by regulatory compliance: HIPAA, PCI-DSS, or GDPR
- Once viloations are identified, DLP enforces remediateion with alerts, encryption, and other protective actions to prevent end users from accidentally or maliciously sharing data that could put the organization at risk
- DLP software and tools monitor and control endpoint activities, filter data streams on corporate networks, and monitor data in the cloud to protect data at rest, in motion, and in use
- Provides reporting to meet compliance and auditing requirements and identify areas of weakness and anomalies for forensics and incident response

#### 3 Main Use Cases for DLP

1. Personal Information Protection / Compliance
2. IP Protection
3. Data Visibiilty

#### 7 Trends Driving DLP Adoption

1. The Growth of the CISO Roles
2. Evolving Compliance Mandates
3. There are More Places to Protect Your Data
4. Data Breaches are Frequent and Large
5. Your Organization's Stolen Data is Worth More
6. There's More Data to Steal
7. There's a Security Talent Shortage

#### DLP Best Practices

- Determine Primary Data Protection Objective
- Determine the Most Appropriate DLP Deployment Architecture or Combination of Architectures
  - 4 Main DLP Deployment Architectures are:
        1. Endpoint DLP
        2. Network DLP
        3. Discovery
        4. Cloud
- Need a Buy-In from Other Executives
- Establish Evalutation Criteria:
  - What types of deployment architectures are offered?
    - Do they support Windows, Linux, and OS X with feature parity?
    - What deployment options do they offer? Do they provide managed services?
    - Do you need to defend against mainly internal or external threats? Or both?
    - Do you need to perform content- or context-based inspection and classification? Will your users be able to self-classify documents? Do you need a blend of multiple methods?
    - Are you most concerned with protecting structured or unstructured data?
    - Do you plan to see and enforce data movement based on policies, events, or users?
    - What compliance regulations are you bound by? What new regulations are on the horizon?
    - Who are their technology alliance partners and what technologies would you like to integrate with your DLP?
    - How quickly do you need to deploy your DLP program?
    - Will you need additional staff to manage your DLP program?
- Clearly Define the Roles and Responsibilities
- Start with a Clearly Defined Quick Win
- Work Together with Business Unit Heads
- Document Your Processes Carefully
- Define Success Metrics and Share Reporting with Business Leaders
- DLP is a Program, Not a Product

#### DLP 101

1. Data Protection is Everyone's Job
2. Encryption is Important
3. Be Mindful of Insider Threats

#### DLP Tool/Software
