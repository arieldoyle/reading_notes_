### Applying The CIA Triad To Your Enterprise File Transfer

#### CIA Triad

- One of the basic building blocks of information security
- Vital in establishing escure enterprise file transfers
- The three basic principles/objectives in information security:
  - Confidentiality:
    - Restricts access to or knowledge of certain pieces of information to certain individuals
    - Potential risk:
      - Man-in-the-middle attack:
        - Eavesdrops on transmissions or hack directly into the server
    - Countermeasures:
      - Encryption: randers data unreadable until properly decrypted
        - Two Encryption solution categories:
          - Data-at-rest (encryption)
            - Data that is stored on the server [(use SSL encryption: FTPS, HTTPS, WebDAVs or SSH encryption: SFTP)](https://www.jscape.com/blog/ssl-vs-ssh-simplified)
          - Data-in-transit (decryption)
            - Data that is traversing the network (use OpenPGP or disk-level/file-level encryption solutions)
        - Data is encrypted (end-to-end encryption):
          - Before (while in the sender's server)
          - During (while traversing the network)
          - After (upon arrival at the recipient's server)
      - Authentication:
        - Restricts access to data to authorized individuals: 2-factor authentication for example

  - Integrity:
    - Preventing data from being tampered
    - Potential risk:
      - Man-in-the-middle attack: Intercepts data, makes changes, and forwards to intended recipient or hack directly into the server
    - Countermeasures:
      - Security elements that are readily available in SFTP (Secure file transfer protocols): FTPS, HTTPS, SFTP, and WebDAVs
      - Enables file transfer recipients to determin if the files they receive have beemn tampered with
        - [Hash functions](https://www.jscape.com/blog/understanding-hashing)
        - [Digital signatures](https://www.jscape.com/blog/what-is-a-digital-signature)

  - Availability:
    - Ensuring data is accessible when you need it
    - Potential risk:
      - Power interruptions, Network interruptions, Server failures, Missing files, DDoS attacks, Natural disasters
    - Countermeasures:
      - [High availability (HA) cluster](https://www.jscape.com/blog/active-active-vs-active-passive-high-availability-cluster)
        - Set up one or more failover server(s) that can immediately take over should the primary go down (active-passive high availability configuration)
        - Set up two or more server(s) that are both active servers (active-active high availability configuration)
          - Distributes the workload and reduce the chance of a server from going down due to overload

#### CIA Triad in One

- The problem with applying all three elements is that it is complex and time consuming
- One example is [JSCAPE MFT Server](https://www.jscape.com/products/file-transfer-servers/jscape-mft-server), a managed file transfer server that already includes:
  - Data-in-motion encryption through secure file transfer protocols like FTPS, SFTP, HTTPS, WebDAVs, AS2 over HTTPS, and OFTP (secured by SSL)
  - Data-at-rest encryption through OpenPGP
  - End-to-end encryption, which can be achieved through automation-enabling features known as triggers.
  - 2-factor authentication
  - Data integrity checking mechanisms that employ hash functions and digital signatures.
  - Built-in support for High Availability configurations, active-active and active-passive
  - Data Loss Prevention (DLP), which automatically detects the presence of sensitive data and take appropriate action (e.g. cancel the download or apply encryption)
- If you want to give it a test run, JSCAPE MFT Server comes with a FREE, fully-functional evaluation edition that you can [download now](https://www.jscape.com/download-jscape-mft-server?__hstc=&__hssc=&hsCtaTracking=bc0b30b7-ff62-4084-b0f6-2fd6dd7b611e%7C8a2284f9-c213-417a-8269-aa4df7608474)

### What Are MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256 Hashes, and How Do I Check Them?

#### [How Hashes Work, and How They are Used for Data Verification](https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/img_5894fd26536fe.png?trim=1,1&bg-color=000&pad=1,1)

- Hashes are the products of cyrptographic algorithms designed to produce a string of characters of fixed length
- MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256 are all different hashes
  - MD5 and SHA-1 have been found to have collisions: (Mutliple files that result in the same MD5 or SHA-1 hash)
  - Recommend to use SHA-256

#### How to Compare Has Functions on Any Operating System

- [Windows](https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/img_5894fdeca4031.png?trim=1,1&bg-color=000&pad=1,1)
  - SHA-256 shown by default (to change algorithm, input -Algorithm *HASHNAME*) [(for example: -Algorithm MD5 or -Algorithm SHA1)](https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/img_5894fe1cde185.png?trim=1,1&bg-color=000&pad=1,1)
  - (In PowerShell and replace the C: path with your file path):
    - Get-FileHash C:\path\to\file.iso

- [macOS](https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/img_5894fc9b9b5f8.png?trim=1,1&bg-color=000&pad=1,1)
  - SHA-1 shown by default
  - (In Terminal)
    - md5 /path/to/file *MD5*
    - shasum /path/to/file or shasum -a 1 /path/to/file *SHA-1*
    - shasum -a 256 /path/to/file *SHA-256*

- [Linux](https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/img_5894fc0e80b69.png?trim=1,1&bg-color=000&pad=1,1)
  - md5sum /path/to/file *MD5*
  - sha1sum /path/to/file *SHA-1*
  - sha256sum /path/to/file *SHA-256*

#### Some Hashes are Cryptographically Signed for Even More Security

- An attacker could gain control of a Linux distribution’s website and modify the hashes that appear on it, or an attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle attack and modify the web page in transit if you were accessing the website via HTTP instead of encrypted HTTPS
- Linux: cryptographically sign these hashes to help protect against attackers that might attempt to modify the hashes. You’ll want to verify the cryptographic signature to ensure the hash file was actually signed by the Linux distribution if you want to be absolutely sure the hash and file weren’t tampered with
