### Getting Started with Zed Attack Proxy

#### Overview

- Website used as basic introduction for using ZAP to perform security testing for all skill levels
- [pdf version](https://www.zaproxy.org/pdf/ZAPGettingStartedGuide-2.11.pdf)

#### Security Testing Basics

- Software security testing is the process of assessing and testing a system to discover security risks and vulnerabilities of the system and its data
- Common breakout for security testing:
  - Vulnerability Assessment – The system is scanned and analyzed for security issues
  - Penetration Testing – The system undergoes analysis and attack from simulated malicious attackers
  - Runtime Testing – The system undergoes analysis and security testing from an end-user
  - Code Review – The system code undergoes a detailed review and analysis looking specifically for security vulnerabilities
- Risk Assessment is not actually a test, but it the analysis of the perceived severity of different risks and any mitigation steps for those risks

#### More About Penetration Testing

- Pentesting is carried out as if the tester was malicious external attacker with a goal of breaking into the system and either stealing data or carrying out some sort of denial-of-service attack
- Fewer false positives and more accurate, but more time-consuming
- Used to test defense mechanisms, verify response plans, and confirm security policy adherence
- Automated pentesting is an imprtant part of continous integration validation

#### The Pentesting Process

- Explore – The tester attempts to learn about the system being tested. This includes trying to determine what software is in use, what endpoints exist, what patches are installed, etc. It also includes searching the site for hidden content, known vulnerabilities, and other indications of weakness
- Attack – The tester attempts to exploit the known or suspected vulnerabilities to prove they exist
-Report – The tester reports back the results of their testing, including the vulnerabilities, how they exploited them and how difficult the exploits were, and the severity of the exploitation

#### Pentesting Goals

- Search for vulnerabilites so that these vulnerabilities can be addressed
- Verify that a system is not vulnerable to a known class or specific defect
- Verify that the system is no longer vulnerable to a defect (if reported as fixed)

#### Introduciing ZAP

- Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)
- Free, open-source penetration testing tool being maintained under the umbrella of the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)
- Designed specifically for testing web applications
- Flexible and extensible
- Known as the "man-in-the-middle proxy"
  - Stands between the tester's browser and the web application so that it can intercept and inspect messages sent between browser and web applications modify the contents if needed, adn then forward those packets on to the destination
  - Can be used as a stand-alone application and as a daemon [process](https://www.zaproxy.org/getting-started/images/browser-no-proxy.png)
  - If there is another network proxy in use, ZAP can be configured to connect to that [proxy](https://www.zaproxy.org/getting-started/images/browser-network-proxy.png)
  - Provides funtionality for a range of skill levels - from developers to testers new to security testing, to security testing specialists
  - Has versions for each major OS and Docker
  - Additional functionality is freely available from a variety of add-ons in the ZAP Marketplace accessible within the ZAP client
