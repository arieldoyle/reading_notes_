### Understanding SQL Injection, Identification and Prevention

#### Why SQL Injection Matters

- SQL (Standardized Query Language): still the dominant method of inserting, filtering, and retrieving information from a database
- Loads of SQL queries will be coursing through your web applications on almost every page load
- An attacker can exploit flaws in the web application armed with literally nothing but a web browser, some basic SQL knowledge and an internet connection
  - Can extract user data, discovering or resetting credentials and using it as a launch point for deeper assults on the network

#### SQL and Sysadmins

- Fairly common for sysadmins to be tasked with the setup and administration of SQL Servers with little or no practical knowledge of how to actually craft queries and manipulate the data with raw SQL commands
- It is completely necessary to have some SQL Basics firmly in mind when discussing SQL injection attacks: it helps identify vulnerabilities of the applications

#### What is SQL?

- SQL is a full programming language unto itself
- Substitute Query with Command

- [SQL Queries that are a Web Browser](https://github.com/pramsey/pgsql-http)
- [SQL Queries to browse the Server Filesystem](http://hubpages.com/technology/Using-xp_cmdshell-to-Query-the-Windows-File-System)
- SQL basics of the language have not changed much since it was first invented in the early 1970s
  - Some in depth commands differ between major vendors and open source options
  - Basics are the same across the board
- SQLite Follow Along:

#### What is a Database Table?

- Database Tables are the fundamental building block of how data is structured in a database
- A table is simply a list of information
- Similar to sheets in a spreadsheet
  - Each sheet is the list
  - Columns in each sheet are the attributes of the items in that list

- [Same information stored in a database table](https://info.varonis.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/SQL_Injection_-_Google_Docs-1.png?hsLang=en)

#### What are the basic SQL Commands?

- Used to Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) information inside of tables
- Common convention when writing SQL statements: Capitalize SQL Command words and keep the words that would change the statment (tablenames, options, etc) lowercase

#### How to create and update data with SQL?

INSERT INTO
"your-table-name"
(column_name_1, column_name_2)
VALUES
(value_for_column_name_1, value_for_column_name_2)

#### The SQL Update works very similarly

UPDATE
Products
SET
column_name_2 = new_value
WHERE
Column_name_1 = some_value

#### How to read data with SQL?

SELECT
(column_name_1, column_name_2)
FROM
your-table-name

#### How to delete data with SQL?

DELETE FROM
your-table-name
WHERE
column-name_1 = your_value

#### How To Select Data?

SELECT
(column_name_1, column_name_2)
FROM
your-table-name
WHERE
column_name_1 = ?

#### How do Web Frameworks Prevent SQL Injection?

- Web frameworks prevent SQL injection attacks by proviing easy methods of data querying so that developers aren't seduced into writing hideously vulnerable SQL string conatenation statements
- Perform two important tasks:
  - Offer specific user input sanitization countermeasures to defeat common SQL injection patterns: Framework will strip NULL characters, line breaks, single quotes, etc. that are often used to piggyback additional SQL commands into an intended query
  - Provide a syntax for declaring what a SQL statement is suppose to look like before actually trying to execute it. It depends on what framework you're using, the name may vary, but the intent is the same: make sure the form of the SQL statement taht you want to execute is correct prior to running it

#### What is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks?

- Smart Home Hubs
- Network Equipmen
- Fancy Electric Sport Cars
- Android Apps
- iOS Apps

#### What can web servers do to help?

- [Apache](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity)
- [Nginx](https://github.com/nbs-system/naxsi)
- [Internet Information Server](https://blogs.iis.net/wadeh/filtering-for-sql-injection-on-iis-7-and-later)

#### [Defense in Depth Checklist for SQL Injection Attack](https://info.varonis.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/checklist-247x300.png)

- Database
  - Sufficient and appropriate database user permissions set
  - Extraneous or unused database features disabled
  - Database logging enabled
  - Database backup / restore procedure
  - Database connection filtering procedures enabled (example: MySQL has options to prevent execution of multiple SQL statements in a single query)
  - Database drivers up to date
- Application
  - Using filtering options
  - Using parameterization options
  - Using DB calls only when needed? (Could you use a static site generator?)
  - Code lint/checks for potential SQL injection points
  - Manual check for SQL Injection prone points
  - Application logging
- Web Server / Web Firewall
  - Use WAF SQL Injection pre-filters
  - Rate limit to prevent mass SQL Injection attempts
  - Alert on SQL Injection pattern attempts
