### Intrustion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)

#### IDS Defined

- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) identifies incidents and potential threats to a network
- A firewall is there to keep out malicious attacks, while IDS is there to detect suspicious or nefarious activity and notifies the administrators
- Visibility tool that sits off to the side of the network and monitors traffic
- Consists of the management console and sensors
- Can notify the security personnel of:
  - Infections
  - Spyware
  - Key loggers
  - Accidental information leakage
  - Security policy violations
  - Unauthorized clients and servers
  - Configuration errors

#### IDS vs IPS

- Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) are similar to IDS, except they are able to block potential threats without the system administrator getting involved
- IPS can deny legitimate traffic if not configured correctly, so they are not suitable for all applications

#### NIDS vs HIDS

- NIDS (Network Intrusion Detection Systems) and HIDS (Host Intrusion Detection Systems) are complementary systems that differ by the position of the sensors:
  - Network-based: Monitors the ethernet or WiFi traffic
  - Host-based: Monitors the host traffic
