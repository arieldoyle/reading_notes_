### Pros and Cons of IDS

#### IDS Defined

- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) identifies incidents and potential threats to a network
- A firewall is there to keep out malicious attacks, while IDS is there to detect suspicious or nefarious activity and notifies the administrators
- Visibility tool that sits off to the side of the network and monitors traffic
- Consists of the management console and sensors
- Can notify the security personnel of:
  - Infections
  - Spyware
  - Key loggers
  - Accidental information leakage
  - Security policy violations
  - Unauthorized clients and servers
  - Configuration errors

#### IDS vs IPS

- Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) are similar to IDS, except they are able to block potential threats without the system administrator getting involved
- IPS can deny legitimate traffic if not configured correctly, so they are not suitable for all applications

#### NIDS vs HIDS

- NIDS and HIDS are complementary systems that differ by the position of the sensors:
- Both can be used in a hybrid environment to assist in many different scenarios
  - NIDS (Network Intrusion Detection Systems)
    - Network-based: Monitors the ethernet or WiFi traffic // Quickers Responses // Easier to Implement // Cheaper to Implement // No Software Management
    - Looks at packet headers in real-time
    - Detects incidents in real-time, but have more false-positives than HIDS
  - HIDS (Host Intrusion Detection Systems)
    - Host-based: Monitors the host traffic
    - Can find unauthorized users making changes to the system filess
    - Monitors event and audit logs (comparing new entries to attack signatures)

#### Pros of NIDS

- They can be tuned to specific content in network packets
- They can look at data in the context of the protocol
- They can qualify and quantify attacks
- They make it easier to keep up with regulation
- They can boost efficiency

#### Cons of NIDS

- They will not prevent incidents by themselves
- An experienced engineer is needed to administer them
- They do not process encrypted packets
- IP Packets can still be faked
- Flase positives are frequent
- They are susceptible to protocol based attacks
- The signature library needs to be continually updated to detect the latest threats
