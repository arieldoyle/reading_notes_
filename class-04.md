#### Summary

CompTIA Troubleshooting methodology:

1.Identify the problem

- Gather information
- Duplicate the problem, if possible
- Question user

2.Research knowledge base/Internet, if applicable

3.Establish a theory of probable cause

- Questions the obvious (*Little Things!*)
- Consider multiple approaches

4.Test possible theory

5.Establish a plan of action, resolve the problem, and verify system functionality

- Implement the solution or escalate, as necessary
- Verify full system functionality and, if applicable, implement preventive measures

6.Document findings/lessons learned, actions, and outcomes

- First step is to identify the information
  - Understand and be able to possibly duplicate the problem
  - Document everything
  - It's never just one thing
  - Ask lots of questions to the customer (the hands on)
  - Investigate environmental changes
- Start thinking about the problem source
  - Start with the most obvious issues
  - Consider everything

#### In short

Identify, Theorize, Test, Plan, Resolve, and Document
