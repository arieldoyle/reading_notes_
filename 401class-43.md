### Sniffing Attacks

#### Sniffing Introduction

- Investigating something covertly in order to find confidential information
- Tapping the traffic or routing the traffic to a target where it can be captured, analyzed, and monitored
- Usually performed to analyze the network usage, troubleshooting network issues, monitoring the session for development and testing purpose

#### Defining a Sniffing Attack

- [Resource for cyber security attacks](https://www.greycampus.com/cyber-security)
- Sniffing can be performed using an application, hardware devices at both the network and host level
- Sniffing Motives:
  - Getting username and passwords
  - Stealing bank/transaction-related information
  - Spying on email and chat messages
  - Identity theft

#### Types of Sniffing

- Passive Sniffing
  - Happens at the hub then all then all the network traffic can be directly captured by the sniffer
  - Old school way since hubs have been majorly replaced by switches
- Active Sniffing
  - Sniffer floods the switch with bogus requests so that the CAM table gets full
  - Once full, the switch will act as a hub and send the network traffic to all ports

#### Attack Implementations

- MAC Flooding
- DNS Cache Poisoning
- Evil Twin Attack
- MAC Spoofing

#### How to Identify a Sniffer

- Depends on the attack spophistication
- Anti-sniffer software
- A sniffer can be software installed onto your system, a hardware device plugged in, sniffer at a DNS level or other network nodes etc

#### Protocols Vulnerable to Sniffing Attacks

1. HTTP
2. TELNET
3. FTP
4. POP
5. SNMP

#### Top Sniffing Tools

- Wireshark
- dSniff
- Debookee

#### Precautionary Measures Against Sniffing Attacks

1. Connect to Trusted Networks
2. Encrypt! Encrypt! Encrypt!
3. Network Scanning and Monitoring
