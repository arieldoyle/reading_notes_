#### Overview

- Microsoft's Patch Tuesday occurs on the second Tuesday of each month ("B" Updates) - other companys push their updates this same day (adobe for example)
- Releases update packages for the Windows OS and other software apps (including Microsoft Office) and security updates/patches
- This is for predictably for admins
- Pushes 1000 Pacific Standard Time
- Windows 10 checks for updates about once per day
- Admins can postpone them to test them in a sandbox before they are implemented on her network
- Updates can be pushed "out-of-band" updates for particularly critical security flaws
- Updates that are optional are known as "C" and "D" Updates (Bug Fixes and Improvements not security-related)

  - Due to the fact they are tested and tested and tested before release, unlike Patch Tuesday updates
