#### Risk Management and Risk Overview

- Risk management involves comprehensive understanding, analysis, and mitigation of risk to help organizations achieve their information security objective
  - The process of identifying, examining, measuring, mitigating, or transferring risk
  - The lifecycle includes all risk-related actions such as assessment, analysis, mitigation, and ongoing risk monitoring
  - The success can be traced to a thorough understanding of risk
- Risk is fundamentally inherent in every aspect of information security decisions
  - Risk analysis allows us to prioritize these risks and ultimately assign a dollar value to each risk event, and make an informed decision on mitigation method

#### Goals of the Security Model

- Have controls in place to support the mission of the organization
- All the decisions should be based on the risk tolerance of the organization

#### Security Model Time Frame Goals (Planning Horizon)

- Operational: Daily goals that focus on productivity and task-oriented activities to ensure the company's functionality in a smooth and predictable manner
  - Examples:
    - Patching computers as needed
    - Supporting users
    - Updating anti-virus signatures
    - Maintaining the overall network on a daily basis
- Tactical: Corresponding mid-term goals
  - Examples:
    - Moving computers into domains
    - Installing firewalls and segregating the network by creating a DMZ (demilitarized zone)
    - Integrating all workstations and resources into one domain so more central control can be achieved
- Strategic: Long-term goals
  - Examples:
    - Moving all the branches from dedicated communication lines to frame relay
    - Implementing IPSec virtual private networks (VPNs) for all remote users instead of dial-up entry
    - Integrating wireless technology with the comprehensive security solutions and controls existing within the environment

#### Security Fundamentals: CIA

- Confidentiality: Prevent unauthorized disclosure
  - Key Areas for maintaining confidentiality:
    - Social engineering training and awareness
    - Media sanitization
    - Eavesdropping encryption and deterrent controls
- Integrity: Detect modification of information
  - Key Areas for maintaining confidentiality:
    - Implement encryption using intergrity-based algorithms
    - Prevent intential or malicious modification (message digest, MAC, digital signatures)
- Availability: Provide timely and reliable access to resources
  - Key Areas for maintaining availability:
    - Prevent single point of failure
    - Comprehensive fault tolerance (data, hard drives, server, network links, etc)

#### Best Practices to Support CIA

- Separation of Duties
- Mandatory Vacations
- Job Rotation
- Least Privilege
- Need to Know
- Dual Control

#### Best Practices to Support Risk Management

- Every decision starts with looking at risk
- Determine the value of your assets
- Evaluate and identify cost-effective solutions to reduce risk to an acceptable level (rarely can we eliminate risk)
- Keep in mind that safeguards are proactive and countermeasures are reactive
  - Critical definitions for risk management:
    - Asset: Anything of value to the company
    - Vulnerability: A weakness, the absence of a safeguard
    - Threat: Things that could pose a risk to all or part of an asset
    - Threat agent: The entity which carries out the attack
    - Exploit: An instance of compromise
    - Risk: The probability of a threat materializing
    - Controls: Physical, administrative and technical protections (including both safeguards and countermeasures)
  - General Sources of Risk:
    - Weak, unpatched or non-existing anti-virus software
    - Disgruntled employees posing an internal threat
    - Poor physical security controls
    - Weak access controls
    - Lack of change management
    - Lack of formal processes for hardening systems
    - Poorly trained users and lack of awareness

#### Lifecycle of Risk Management

1. Risk Assessment: Categorize, classify and evaluate assets, as well as identify threats and vulnerabilities
2. Risk Analysis: Both qualitative and quantitative
3. Risk Mitigation/Response: Includes reducing or avoiding risk, transferring risk, and accepting or rejecting risk

#### Lifecycle 1: Risk Assessment

- System characterization
- Threat identification
- Vulnerability identification
- Control analysis
- Likelihood determination
- Impact analysis
- Risk determination
- Control recommendation
- Results documentation

#### Lifecycle 2: Risk Analysis

- Analyzed through qualitative and quantitative means
  - Qualitatitive analysis is subjective and descriptive
  - Quantitative analysis is objective and numbers-driven

- AV: Asset value
- EF: Exposure factor
- ARO: Annual rate of occurrence
- Single loss expectancy = AV * EF
- Annual loss expectancy = SLE * ARO
- Risk value = probability * impact (Probability is how likely it is for the threat to materialize and impact the extent of the damage)

#### Lifecycle 3: Mitigating Risk

- Three acceptable responses to risk mitigation:
  1. Reduce
  2. Transfer
  3. Accept

#### Security Governance and Policy

- Industry Standards:
  - BS 7799, ISO 17799, and 27000 Series
  - COBIT and COSO
  - OCTAVE
  - ITIL

#### Approach to Security Management

- Information Management Security Porgram key areas:
  - Roles and responsibilities
  - Policies/standards/procedures/guidelines
  - SLA’s service level agreements/outsourcing
  - Data classification/security
  - Auditing

- Senior Management roles and responsibilities:
  - Development of Support of Policies
  - Allocations of Resources
  - Decisions based on Risk
  - Security Policy
