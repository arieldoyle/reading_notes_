### What is a SOC?

#### SOC 101

- A SOC (Security Operations Center) aka an ISOC (Infroamtion Security Operations Center)
  - Acts as the hub for an organization's security operations
  - Centralized location where information security professionals use technologies to build and maintain the security architecture that monitors, detects, analyzes, and responds to cybersecurity incidents, typically around the clock
  - Consists of both security analysts and engineers that oversees all activity on servers, databases, networks, applications, endpoint devices, websites, and other systems in order to pinpoint potential security threats and thwart them ASAP and monitor relevant external sources that may affect the organization's security posture.
- A GSOC (Global Security Operation Center)
  - Coordinates security offices that literally span the globe
  - Prevent each location from repeating tasks and functions
  - Reduce Overhead
  - Ensure that the security team has a big-picture view of what is happening across the entir organization

#### Benefits of SOC

- Respond faster
- Protect consumer and customer trust
- Minimize costs

#### [SOC Capabilities](https://www.splunk.com/content/dam/splunk2/images/data-insider/siem/what-does-a-soc-do.svg)

- Provide proactive, around-the-clock surveillance of networks, hardware and software for threat and breach detection, and incident response
- Offer expertise on all the tools your organization uses, including third-party vendors, to ensure they can easily resolve security issues
- Install, update and troubleshoot application software
- Monitor and manage firewall and intrusion prevention systems
- Scan and remediate antivirus, malware and ransomware solutions
- Manage email, voice and video traffic
- Help with patch management and whitelisting
- Provide deep analysis of security log data from various sources.
- Analyze, investigate and document security trends
- Investigate security breaches to understand the root cause of attacks and prevent future breaches
- Enforce security policies and procedures
- Supply backup, storage and recovery

##### The 3 Most Common SOC Types

- Internal SOC
- Virtual COS
- Outsourced SOC

#### How the SOC Works

- Level 1: First line of responders
- Level 2: More experienced responders
- Level 3: High-level expert security analysts
- Level 4: High-level managers and chief officers with the most experience

#### Difference between a SOC and NOC

- SOC focuses on monitoring, detecting, and analyzing an organization's security health 24/7/365
  - SOC engineers and analysts search for cyber threats and attempted attacks, and respond before an organization's data or systems are compromised
- NOC (Network Operations Center) ensures that the network performance and speed are up to par and that downtime is limited
  - NOC personnel search for any issues that could slow network speed or cause downtime

#### The Best Practices for Building a SOC

- Develop a strategy
- Make sure you have visibility across your entire organization
- Invest in the right tools and services
  - Security information and event management (SIEM)
  - Endpoint protection systems
  - Firewall
  - Automated application security
  - Asset discovery system
  - Data monitoring tool
  - Governance, risk and compliance (GRC) system
  - Vulnerability scanners and penetration testing
  - Log management system
- Hire the best and train them well
  - Ethical hacking
  - Cyber forensics.
  - Reverse engineering
  - Intrusion prevention system expertise

#### The Bottom Line: Invest in a team of security professionals
