### OSI Model

#### Layers of the OSI

1. Physical
2. Data Link

- Physical/MAC (Media Access Control) Address: example = FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
  - 12 hexadecimal numbers: The first six numbers are useful in identifying the manufacturer of the network interface card. The last six numbers are assigned by the card manufacturer, providing a unique addressing scheme. This avoids the possibility of having two computers on the same network with the same physical address.
- [Ethernet Frame](https://comptiacdn.azureedge.net/webcontent/images/default-source/blogs/12-2-blog-article-2.png)

3. Network

- Logical/IP Address: Layer 3 addresses are divided in a fashion that identifies a specific network address and a specific host or group of hosts
  - IPv4
  - IPv6

4. Transport
5. Session
6. Presentation
7. Application

### What is Wireshark

#### Overview

- Wireshark is used for:
  1. Packet Capture: Wireshark listens to a network connection in real time and then grabs entire streams of traffic – quite possibly tens of thousands of packets at a time.
  2. Filtering: Wireshark is capable of slicing and dicing all of this random live data using filters. By applying a filter, you can obtain just the information you need to see.
  3. Visualization: Wireshark, like any good packet sniffer, allows you to dive right into the very middle of a network packet. It also allows you to visualize entire conversations and network streams.

- Wireshark is not an IDS
- IT users need to understand network protocols: TCP, UDP, DHCP, ICMP, and the three-way TCP handshake
- Cannot decrypt encrypted traffic
- Network packets are easily spoofed

#### Installing Wireshark

[Download Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/)

- For Windows, pick your version
- For Linux, run these commands, then reboot
  - $ sudo apt-get install wireshark
  - $ sudo dpkg-reconfigure wireshark-common
  - $ sudo usermod -a -G wireshark $USER
  - $ newgrp wireshark

  - You have to have admin/root user permissions to run wireshark

#### Wireshark Fundamentals

- Colors in Wireshark (default)
  - Light purple: TCP
  - Light blue: UDP
  - Black: Packets with errors
  - Light green: HTTP traffic
  - Light yellow: Windows-specific traffic, including Server Message Blocks (SMB) and NetBIOS
  - Dark yellow: Routing
  - Dark gray: TCP SYN, FIN and ACK traffic

#### Filtering

- ip.addr: Specifies an IPv4 address
- ipv6.addr: Specifies an IPv6 address
- src: Source - where the packet came from
- dst: Destination - where the packet is going
- &&: Means “and,” as in, “Choose the IP address of 192.168.2.1 and 192.168.2.2”
- ==: Means “equals,” as in “Choose only IP address 192.168.2.1”
- !: Means “not,” as in, do not show a particular IP address or source port
- tcp.port==8080: Filters packets to show a port of your own choosing – in this case, port 8080
- !(ip.src == 162.248.16.53): Shows all packets except those originating from 162.248.16.53
- !(ipv6.dst == 2607:f8b0:400a:15::b): Shows all packets except those going to the IPv6 address of 2607:f8b0:400a:15::b
- ip.addr == 192.168.4.1 && ip.addr == 192.168.4.2: Shows both 192.168.4.1 and 192.168.4.2
- http.request: Shows only http requests – useful when troubleshooting or visualizing web traffic
