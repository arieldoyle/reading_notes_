### CIDR

- CIDR notation is a way of representing a CIDR block:
  - A range of IP Adresses
- Goal:
  - Have enough Ip addresses available without making the CIDR block too large/wasteful
- CIDR notation is represented as 0.0.0.0/0:
  - The final digit after the "/" represents how many bits make up the mask

### What is Network Segmentation and Why It Matters

#### Overview

- Network Segmentation is when different parts of the network (network zones) are separated by devices like bridges, switches, and routers
- Firewalls are very strict and follow established firewall rules, but they donâ€™t do everything to protect your digital assets
- Whether you are running a virtual local area network (LAN) in the cloud or running an SDN-powered architecture, network segmentation will protect your assets
- Everyone needs Network Segmentation (whether physical or virtual) to meet security standards for the business and network

#### Benefits

- Limiting access privileges to those who truly need it
- Protecting the network from widespread cyberattacks
- Boosting network performance by reducing the number of users in specific zones
- Damage control and limitation in case of an incident via the smaller attack surface
- Improved access control for external and internal network security
- Reducing the attack plane and scope of compliance requirements related auditing
- Improved performance with less congestion on network traffic
- Better analytics around network monitoring, network access and network devices
- Endpoint device protection, especially important as IoT devices become more common

#### Types of Network Segmentation

- Users
- Screened Subnet
- Guest Network
- IT Workstations
- Servers by Department
- VoIP/Communications
- Traditional Physical Security
- Industrial Control Systems
- Customer Databases
