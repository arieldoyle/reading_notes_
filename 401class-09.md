### What is Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)?

#### Defined

- PKI is a technology for authenticating users and devices in the digital world
- Securely assciate a key with an entity
- One or more trusted parties digitally sign documents certifying that a particular cryptographic key belongs to a particular user or device
- Keys are used as an identity for the user in digital network
- Users and devices that have keys are called entities
- A trust party signing the document associating the key with the device: Certificate Authority (CA)
- Documents are called certificates
- Uses public key cryptography:
  - Secret key of each entity is only known by that entity and is used for signing: Private Key
  - Derives the Public Key
    - Used to verify signatures but cannot be used to sign
    - Made available to anyone and is typically included in the certificate document

### X.509 Standard

- Public key infrastructure uses this machine-readable certificate format standard
- Maintained by the Internet Engineering Task Force (RFC 3280)

#### Common Uses of Certificates

- Secure Web Sites (HTTPS)
- Authenticating Users and Computers (SSH)
- Email Signing and Encryption (S/MIME)

#### Security Limitations of Public Key Infrastructure

- Main weakness of public PKI: Any CA can sign a certificate for any person or computer
- Intel agencies can use fradulent certificates for espionage, malware injection, and forging messages or evidency to disrupt or discredit adversaries
- Some organizations run their own private key infrastructures: they run their own CA

#### SSH's Role in the Development of Public Key Infrastructure

- [Early pioneers of PKI](https://www.ssh.com/pki/legacy/)
- Participlated in standardization work for X.509v3
- Proposed an alternative approach called SPKI (Simple Public Key Infrastructure)
