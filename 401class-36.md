### Cross-site Scripting

#### Cross-site Scripting Defined

- XSS (Cross-site Scripting) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to compromise the interactions that users have with a vulnerable application
- Allows attacker to circumvent the same origin policy, which is designed to segregate different websites from each other
- These vulnerabilities normally allow an attacker to masquerade as a victim user, to carry out any actions that the user is able to perform, and to sccess any of the user's data
- If victim user has privileged access within the application, then the attacker might be able to gain full control over all the application's functionality and data

#### How XSS Works

- Manipulating a vulnerable website so that it returns malicious JavaScript to users

- [XSS Labs](https://portswigger.net/web-security/all-labs#cross-site-scripting)

#### XSS Proof of Concept

- You can solve the mjority of the XSS labs by invoking alert () or print () fucntion in a simulated victim's browser/chrome browser

#### What are the Types of XSS Attacks

- [Reflected XSS](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/reflected): where the malicious script comes from the current HTTP request
- [Stored XSS](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/stored): where the malicious script comes from the website's database
- [DOM-based XSS](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/dom-based): where the vulnerability exists in client-side code rather than server-side code

#### What can XSS be Used for?

- Impersonate or masquerade as the victim user
- Carry out any action that the user is able to perform
- Read any data that the user is able to access
- Capture the user's login credentials
- Perform virtual defacement of the web site
- Inject trojan functionality into the web site

#### Impact of XSS Vulnerabilities

- In a brochureware application, where all users are anonymous and all information is public, the impact will often be minimal
- In an application holding sensitive data, such as banking transactions, emails, or healthcare records, the impact will usually be serious
- If the compromised user has elevated privileges within the application, then the impact will generally be critical, allowing the attacker to take full control of the vulnerable application and compromise all users and their data

#### How to Find and Test for XSS Vulnerabilties

- [Burp Suite's web vulnerability scanner](https://portswigger.net/burp/vulnerability-scanner)

#### [How to Prevent XSS Attacks](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/preventing)

- Filter input on arrival. At the point where user input is received, filter as strictly as possible based on what is expected or valid input
- Encode data on output. At the point where user-controllable data is output in HTTP responses, encode the output to prevent it from being interpreted as active content. Depending on the output context, this might require applying combinations of HTML, URL, JavaScript, and CSS encoding
- Use appropriate response headers. To prevent XSS in HTTP responses that aren't intended to contain any HTML or JavaScript, you can use the Content-Type and X-Content-Type-Options headers to ensure that browsers interpret the responses in the way you intend
- Content Security Policy. As a last line of defense, you can use Content Security Policy (CSP) to reduce the severity of any XSS vulnerabilities that still occur.
