### SPAN vs TAP

#### General

- SPAN: Port Mirroring (Roving Analysis)
  - Method of monitoring network traffic
  - Forwards a copy of each incoming and/or outgoing packet from one (or serveral) port(s) (or VLAN) of a switch to another port where the analysis device is connected
  - Managed locally or remotely
  - Cons:
    - It can consume significant CPU resources while active
    - There is a risk of not receiving some packets (such as media errors)
    - In the case of traffic congestion at the switch level, port mirroring is likely to drop some traffic (because the SPAN process does not have priority)
    - In some cases, a better solution for long-term monitoring may be a passive TAP or an Ethernet repeater (”hub”)
    - Not adequate for fully utilized full-duplex links (packets may be dropped)
    - Filters out physical errors
    - Impact on the switch’s CPU
    - Can alter the timing of the frame (with an impact on response time analysis)
    - SPAN has a lesser priority than port to port data transfer
- TAP: Terminal Access Point
  - Hardware device which can passively capture traffic on a network
  - Commonly used to monitor the traffic between two points in the network
  - Best practice to capture network between two points consisting of physical cables
  - Network TAP has at least 3 ports:
    - A port
    - B port
    - Monitor port
  - Can be used in security applications due to them being non-obtrusive, non-detectable on the network, deal with full-pulex and non-shared networks, and pass-through traffic even if the tap stops working/loses power (usually)
  - Cons:
    - The device may require two listening interfaces on the analysis device
    - Costly
    - No visibility on intra-switch traffic
    - Not appropriate for the observation of a narrow traffic range
  - Pros:
