### CIS Benchmarks

#### What are CIS Benchmarks

- Developed by a global community of cybersecurity professionals (the Center for Internet Security - CIS)
- Collection of documented industry best practices for securely configuring IT systems, software, networks, and cloud infrastructure
- Currently, there are more than 140 CIS Benchmarks in total across secen core technology catergories

#### About the CIS

- Non-Profit organization established in OCT2020
- Driven by a global IT community with the common goal of identifying, developing, validating, promoting, and sustaining best practice solutions for cyber defense
- Produced and distributed several free tools and solutions for enterprises of all sizes that are designed to strengthen this cybersecurity readiness
- Most commonly known for their CIS Controls:
  - A comprehensive guide of 20 safguards and countermeasures for effective cyber defense
  - Provide prioritized checklist that organizations can implement to reduce their cyber attacks surface significantly
  - Referenced by CIS Benchmarks when building recommendations for better-secured system configurations

#### CIS Benchmarks Organization

- Includes multiple config recommendations based on two profile levels:
  - Level 1 Benchmark Profiles:
    - Cover base-level configurations that are easier to implement
    - Minimal impact on business functionality
  - Level 2 Benchmark Profiles:
    - Intended for high-security environments
    - Require more coordination and planning to implement with minimal business disruption

- Seven core categories of CIS Benchmarks:
    1. Operating Systems Benchmarks: Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Apple OSX / Best practice guidelines for local and remote access restrictions, user profiles, driver installation protocols, and internet browser configs
    2. Server Software Benchmarks: Microsoft Windows Server, SQL Server, VMware, Docker, and Kubernetes / Recommendations for configuring Kubernetes PKI certificates, API server settings, server admin controls, vNetwork policies, and storage restrictions
    3. Cloud Provider Benchmarks: AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google, IBM, and other popular public clouds / Guidelines for configuring identity and access management (IAM), system logging protocols, network configurations, and regulatory compliance safeguards
    4. Mobile Device Benchmarks: iOS and Android / Developer options and settings, OS privacy configurations, browser settings, and app permissions
    5. Network Device Benchmarks: General and Vendor-Specific / Security configuration guidelines for network devices and applicable hardware from Cisco, Palo Alto Networks, Juniper, and others
    6. Desktop Software Benchmarks: Microsoft Office and Exhange Server, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari Browser / Focus on email privacy and server settings, mobile device management, default browser settings, and third-party software blocking
    7. Multi-function Print Device Benchmarks: multi-function printers in office settings / firmware updating, TCP/IP configurations, wireless access configuration, user management, and File sharing

#### CIS Hardened Images

- Enables enterprises to perform computer operations cost-effectively without needing to invest in additional hardware or software
- More secure than standard virtual images
- Significantly limit the security vulnerabilities that can lead to a cyber attack
- Designed and configured in compliance with CIS Benchmarks and Controls
- Full compliant with various regulatory compliance organizations
- Available for use in nearly all major cloud computer platforms
- Easy to deploy and manage

#### CIS Benchmarks and Regulatory Compliance

- 'Map to" security and data privacy reulatory frameworks, including:
  - NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) Cyber Security Framwork
  - PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
  - HIPAA (Health Insurance Portabiilty and Accountability Act)
  - ISO/EIC 2700
- Organizations operating in an industry governed by these types of regulations can make significant progress toward compliance by adhering to CIS Benchmarks
- CIS Controls and Hardened Images can help support an organization's compliance with GDPR (the EU's General Data Protection Regulation)

### Benefits of CIS Benchmarks

- The collected expertise of a global community of IT and cybersecurity professionals
- Regularly updated, step-by-step guidance for securing every area of the IT infrastructure
- Compliance management consistency
- A flexibility template for securely adopting new cloud services and for executing digital transformation strategies
- Easy-to-deploy configurations for improved operational efficiency and sustainability

#### CIS Benchmarks and IBM Cloud

- IBM partnered with CIS for years to establish the best security process for customers utilizing their cloud services and supporting technologies
- IBM has been awarded CIS Security Software Certification Benchmarks on a variety of IBM products
- Newest benchmark: IBM Cloud Foundations includes:
  - IAM (Identity and Access Management)
  - Logging and Monitoring
  - Compute
  - Networking
  - Storage
  - DBaaS (Database-as-a-Service)
  - Kubernetes
  - Key Encryption
  - IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center
