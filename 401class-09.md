### What is Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)?

#### Defined

- PKI is a technology for authenticating users and devices in the digital world
- Securely assciate a key with an entity
- One or more trusted parties digitally sign documents certifying that a particular cryptographic key belongs to a particular user or device
- Keys are used as an identity for the user in digital network
- Users and devices that have keys are called entities
- A trust party signing the document associating the key with the device: Certificate Authority (CA)
- Documents are called certificates
- Uses public key cryptography:
  - Secret key of each entity is only known by that entity and is used for signing: Private Key
  - Derives the Public Key
    - Used to verify signatures but cannot be used to sign
    - Made available to anyone and is typically included in the certificate document

### X.509 Standard

- Public key infrastructure uses this machine-readable certificate format standard
- Maintained by the Internet Engineering Task Force (RFC 3280)
