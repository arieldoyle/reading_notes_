### Proxies

#### Reverse Proxy Defined

- A server that sits in front of ***web servers*** and forwards client (e.g web browser) requests to those web servers
- Implemented to increase security, performance, and reliability
- It intercepts client requests to the origin server of a website at the network edge, then send requests to and from the origin server
- [Example of a common reverse proxy](https://www.cloudflare.com/img/learning/cdn/glossary/reverse-proxy/reverse-proxy-flow.svg)
  - A: User PC
  - B: Proxy Server
  - C: Website's origin server (where the website data is stored)

#### (Forward) Proxy Server Defined

- Server that sits in front of a front of ***client machines***
- It intercepts the requests made by those clients and then communicates with web servers on behalf of those clients
- [Example of a common web proxy](https://www.cloudflare.com/img/learning/cdn/glossary/reverse-proxy/forward-proxy-flow.svg)
  - A: User PC
  - B: Proxy Server
  - C: Website's origin server (where the website data is stored)

#### Reasons for a Proxy Server

- To avoid state or institutional browsing restrictions
- To block access to certain content
- To protect their identity online

#### A Simplified Way to Sum Up the Difference Between a Reverse and Forward Proxy

- Forward proxy sits in front of a client and ensures that no origin server ever communicates directly with that specific client
- Reverse proxy sits in front of an origin server and ensures that no client ever communicates directly with that origin server

#### Reasons for a Reverse Proxy

- Load balancing
- Protection from attacks
- Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB)
- Caching
- SSL encryption
