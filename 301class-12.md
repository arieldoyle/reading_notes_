### Computer Network AAA

#### General

- AAA: Authentication, Autherization, and Accounting
- Provides extra level of security to remote accesses
- Implemented by using either:
  - Local Database:
    - Uses local running configs of the router/switch to implement AAA
    - Creates users first for authentication, then assigns privileges for authorization
  - ACS Server:
    - External config for both a router and ACS
    - Creates user with a separate customized method list for AAA
    - Client send authentication requests to ACS server and server makes decisions based on credentials given
- If the ACS Server fails to authenticate, the admin should use the local database as a backup in the AAA method list

#### Authentication

- Identify that the user is valid with requested input of credentials of username and password

#### Authorization

- Determine what resources the user is allowed to access and operations they can perform

#### Accounting

- Monitors and captures the events done by the user while accessing the network resources

### RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial In Service)

#### Inside RADIUS

- Client sends server a RADIUS auth request
- Server starts querying modules in auth section and finds the right module to handle request
- Module looks for key attributes like MS-CHAP, CHAP, or EAP
