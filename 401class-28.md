### Log Tampering 101

#### Four Step Process of Covering Tracks by Tampering with Logs

1. Disabling auditing (Auditpol)
2. Clearing logs (Clearlogs.exe / Metasploit: Meterpreter > clearev / Windows Event Viewerleft-hand pane / Linux: Shred -vfzu auth.log)
3. Modifying logs (Text editors)
4. Erasing command history (~/.bash_history)

#### Conclusion

- Organizations should centrally store their system logs as much as possible to help confound malicious hackers, preferably with a SIEM solution.
