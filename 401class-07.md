## Protecting Data at Rest with Device Encryption

### Data Protection

#### Defined: Data-in-Transit and Data-at-Rest

- Data-in-Transit: (data in motion) actively moving from one location to another such as across the internet or through a private network
  - Data protection in transit protects the data while it is traveling from network to network or being transferred from a local storage device to a cloud storage
- Data-at-Rest: not actively moving from device to device or network to network (data stored on a hard drive, laptop, flash drive, or archived/stored in some other way)
  - Data protection at rest aims to secure inactive data stored on any device or network

#### The Role of Encryption in Data Protection in Transit and at Rest

- Protection in both states are required and there are multiple approaches to protecting the data
- Encryption plays a major role in data protection
  - For data-in-transit, enterprises often encrypt sensitive data prior to moving and/or use encrypted connections like HTTPS, SSL, TLS, FTPS, etc to protect the data
  - For data-at-rest, enterprises can encrypt sensitive files prior to storing them and/or choose to encrypt the storage drive itself

#### Best Practices for Data Protection in Transit and at Rest

- Encryption
- Network security controls to protext data in transit (firewalls and network access control)
- Use proacctive security measures that identify at-risk data and implemtn effective data protection for data in transit and at rest
- Choose data protection solutions with policies that enable uqser prompting, blocking, or automatic encryption for sensitive data in transit
- Create policies for systematically categorizing and classifying all company data (no matter where it is) to applied protections measures while data remains at rest and triggered when data classified as at-risk is accessed, used, or transferred
- Evaluate cloud vendors based on security measures, but do not rely on them to secure your data (no matter if you utilize a public, private, or hybrid cloud provider)
