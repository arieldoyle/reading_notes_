### Penetration Testing

### What is Penetration Testing?

- AKA: Pen Test
- Simulated cyber attack against your computer system to check for exploitable vulnerabilities
- In context to web application security: pen testing is commonly used to augment a WAF (web application firewall)
- Can involve the attempted breaching of any number of application systems: APIs/Servers, to uncover vulnerabilities: code injections
- Insights provided by the pen test can be used to fine-tune the WAF security policies and patch detected vulnerabilities

#### [Pen Testing Stages](https://www.imperva.com/learn/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2019/01/pen-testing.jpg.webp)

1. Planning and Reconnaissance
    - Test goals are defined
    - Intelligence is gathered
2. Scanning
    - Scanning tools are used to understand how a target responds to intrusions
3. Gaining Access
    - Web application attacks are staged to uncover a target's vulnerabilties
4. Maintaining Access
    - APTs are imitated to see if a vulnerability can be used to maintain access
5. Analysis and WAF Configuration
    - Results are used to configure WAF settings before testing is run again

#### Pen Testing Methods

- External Testing:
  - Tester targets assets of a company that are visible on the internet
- Internal Testing:
  - Tester has access to an application behind its firewall (malicious insider/successful phishing attack)
- Blind Testing:
  - Tester is only given the name of the enterprise
  - Security personnel have prior knowledge of the attack
- Double-blind Testing:
  - Tester is only given the name of the enterprise
  - Security personnel have no prior knowledge of the attack
- Targeted Testing:
  - Both the tester and security personnel work together and keep each other appraised of their movements

#### Pen Testing and WAF

- Exclusive, yet mutually beneficial security measures
- Pen testing and WAF satisify certain PCI DSS and SOC 2 requirements independently

### OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)

#### OSINT Defined

- Refers to all the publicly available information
