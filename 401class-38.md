### Resources

- [What is Burp Suite?](https://www.technipages.com/what-is-burp-suite)

### Burp Suite

#### Overview

- A suite of tools from PortSwigger designed to aid in the penetration testing of web applications over both HTTP and HTTPS
- Primary tool is a proxy designed to allow the analysis and editing of web traffic
- Proxy can intercept web requests and responses and read and edit them in real-time before they reach their respective destinations
- Versions available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux (along with a JAR file)

#### Tools within Burp Suite

- Many tools included in Burp Suite are designed to integrate with the main proxy and can have requests imported to them
  - Intruder allows you to import a request and then configure an arrange of payloads to attempt and can then run through them automatically
  - Repeater allows you to import a web request and make manual modifications to it and see the response side by side allowing you to make minor adjustments to attempted exploits and easily see if it is working
  - Dashboard feature shows a list of identified issues (manually checked for a false positive)
  - Sequencer is designed to analyse the randomness of data such as session IDs, CSRF tokens, and password reset tokens
  - The analysis requires more than 100 samples, but can identify weaknesses in how supposedly random values are being generated
  - Decoder allows you to decode strings from a range of encoding standards as well as allowing you to encode data again
  - Comparer allows you to compare two strings to check for minor differences
  - A broad range of community-written extensions are available for free from within the application
  - There is a paid for plan, but Community Edition supports most features
