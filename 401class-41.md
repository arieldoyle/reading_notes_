### Penetration Testing

### What is Penetration Testing?

- AKA: Pen Test
- Simulated cyber attack against your computer system to check for exploitable vulnerabilities
- In context to web application security: pen testing is commonly used to augment a WAF (web application firewall)
- Can involve the attempted breaching of any number of application systems: APIs/Servers, to uncover vulnerabilities: code injections
- Insights provided by the pen test can be used to fine-tune the WAF security policies and patch detected vulnerabilities

#### [Pen Testing Stages](https://www.imperva.com/learn/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2019/01/pen-testing.jpg.webp)

1. Planning and Reconnaissance
    - Test goals are defined
    - Intelligence is gathered
2. Scanning
    - Scanning tools are used to understand how a target responds to intrusions
3. Gaining Access
    - Web application attacks are staged to uncover a target's vulnerabilties
4. Maintaining Access
    - APTs are imitated to see if a vulnerability can be used to maintain access
5. Analysis and WAF Configuration
    - Results are used to configure WAF settings before testing is run again

#### Pen Testing Methods

- External Testing:
  - Tester targets assets of a company that are visible on the internet
- Internal Testing:
  - Tester has access to an application behind its firewall (malicious insider/successful phishing attack)
- Blind Testing:
  - Tester is only given the name of the enterprise
  - Security personnel have prior knowledge of the attack
- Double-blind Testing:
  - Tester is only given the name of the enterprise
  - Security personnel have no prior knowledge of the attack
- Targeted Testing:
  - Both the tester and security personnel work together and keep each other appraised of their movements

#### Pen Testing and WAF

- Exclusive, yet mutually beneficial security measures
- Pen testing and WAF satisify certain PCI DSS and SOC 2 requirements independently

### OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)

#### OSINT Defined

- Refers to all the publicly available information
- Introduced during WWII as an intelligence tool by many nations security agencies
- OSINT sources are distinguished from other forms of intelligence becasue they must be legally accessible by the public without breaching any copyright or privacy laws

#### OSINT Types

- Internet
- Traditional Mass Media
- Specialized Journals, Academic Publications, Reporting, Profiles, Resumes, Dissertations
- Photos and Videos (including Metadata)
- Geospatial Information (including Maps and Commercial Imagery Products)

#### OSINT Organizations (Not Definite List, just most well-known organizations)

##### Government Organizations

- Open Source Center (US Government Controlled)
- BBC Monitoring (UK Official Bodies)

##### Private Sector

- Jane's Information Group (British Company)
- Economist Intelligence Unit (Britich Economist Group)
- Oxford Analytica

#### Parties Interested in OSINT Information

- Government
- International Organizations
- Law Enforcement Agencies
- Business Corporations
- Pen Testers and Black Hat Hackers/Criminal Organizations
- Privacy-Conscious Perople
- Terrorist Organizations

#### Infromation Gathering Types

- Passive Collection
  - Most used type of OSINT collection
  - Collect information via publically available resources only
- Semi-Passive Collection
  - No in-depth investigation
  - Avoids attention/detection
- Active Collection
  - Interact directly with the target
  - Example: Social Engineering

#### Benefits of OSINT

1. Less Risky
2. Cost Effective
3. Ease of Accessibility
4. Legal Issues
5. Aiding Financial Investigators
6. Fighting Against Online Counterfeiting
7. Maintaining National Security and Political Stability

#### Challenges of OSINT

1. Sheer Volume of Data
2. Reliability of Sources
3. Human Efforts
