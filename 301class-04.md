#### Overview

- Group Policy iprovides a centralized place for admins to manage and configure OS, Applications, and User Settings
- Enhances security of user PCs and helps defend about both internal and external attacks

#### What is a GPO(Group Policy Object)?

- Group of settings that are created using the MMC (Microsoft Management Console) Group Policy Editor
- Can be associated with one or mutliple AD containers (sites, domains, or OUs (Organization Units))
- AD applies GPOs in the same, logical order: local policies, site policies, domain policies and OU policies

#### Examples of GPOs

- Determine the home page that a user sees upon browser launch
- Define which network connected printers appears
- Restrict internet connection options, programs, and screen time

#### How Are GPOs Processed?

- LSDOU (local, site, domain, OU)

#### Should You Use GPO?

- Yes, it fills in security gaps from the out-of-the-box Windows to what you need it for
- Implement policy of least privilege (Disable Local ADMIN and grant admin rights to individuals/groups)

#### Benefits of GPO for Data Security

- Password Policy
- Systems Management
- Health Checking

#### Limitations of GPO

- Not really user-friendly
- GPO updates (timed incorrectly) could bog your network traffic down
- Not immune to cyberattacks (needs a GP auditing and monitoring solution to help detect this)

#### How Lepide Helps

- Lepide is a GP auditing solution
- Sends ADMINs real-time alerts and roll back options
