### Computer Forensics

#### Computer Forensics Overview

- Key in the battle against cyber threats
- Cyber forensic specialists are charged with helping increase security, fight crime, and create a better, safer future
- Focused on helping organizations deal with network breaches

#### Computer Forensics Careers

- [Computer forensic](https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/forensics) specialists investigate security issues, data breaches, and other cyber crimes
  - Law enforcement, criminal justice, forensics, and cybersecurity all come together inside this field
  - Many computer forensic specialists work for law enforcement agencies
  - Recover documents, photos, emails, and other files from computer systems, hard drives, and other devices
  - Often work on “cyber crime” and digital cases and examine computer systems to help find digital evidence of illegal activity
  - Help determine how a breach happened in a computer system—the main focus of these experts is to look at digital breaches and hacks that have already happened, and learn from them for the future

#### Computer Forensics vs. Cybersecurity

- Cybersecurity:
  - Focused on prevention while computer forensics is more reactionary in nature
  - Experts work to keep hackers out
  - Cybersecurity team will specifically create security systems to keep data and information secure
- Computer Forensics:
  - Experts focus on how to move forward once a hacker has gotten in
  - In the event that cybersecurity team's efforts fail, a computer forensics team finds how the breach happened and works to recover the data

- Both work directly together in keeping cyber criminals at bay
- Both career avenues have similar educational options, but there are different job responsibilities and titles associated with the different career paths
  - Cybersecurity analysts, penetration testers, ethical hackers, cybersecurity engineers, and cybersecurity architects are just a few of the job titles you can pursue in the cybersecurity realm
  - While different in responsibility, a degree in computer science or cybersecurity can be key in helping you be prepared for either one of these IT roles

#### Why is Cyber Forensics Important?

- It’s clear to see that security breaches are a huge issue in our technology-fueled world
- That makes cyber forensics an increasingly important element of our protection
- Cyber forensics is focused on helping us recover and learn from past hacking to propel a more secure future

#### Cyber Forensics Jobs

- Information security crime investigator. An information security crime investigator often works specifically with lawyers and law enforcement to find evidence that may be on computers, phones, or other technology as part of a criminal investigation.
- Computer forensics engineer. A computer forensics engineer focuses on evaluating software and architecture to help learn what happened in a breach or threat.
- Digital forensics. Digital forensics is another term for cyber or computer forensics, which is the basic idea of analyzing data and software to learn how a breach occurred, or look for evidence.
- Computer forensics. Computer forensics is another term for cyber or digital forensics, which is the basic idea of analyzing data and software to learn how a breach occurred, or look for evidence.
- Cyber forensics. Cyber forensics is another term for cyber or digital forensics, which is the basic idea of analyzing data and software to learn how a breach occurred, or look for evidence.
- Computer forensics specialist. A computer forensics specialist is a more entry-level position in the field, focusing on scans and research into a breach.
- Computer forensics analyst. A computer forensics analyst focuses on analyzing data and information to help provide as evidence in a cyber crime, or in understanding a data breach.
- Computer forensics investigator or examiner. A computer forensics investigator or examiner is similar to a forensics analyst—they are responsible to dive deep into programs and software to learn about a digital breach or a hack, and help recover data.
- Computer forensics technician. Computer forensics technicians are responsible for the more detailed, technical work of forensics systems. They may be in charge of data recovery, logging information about a breach or attack, or pulling specific data as evidence for law enforcement.

#### Cyber Forensic Job Responsibilities

- Readiness. This stage helps the investigator make sure they are ready to take on investigation at any time. They ensure everyone has been trained correctly, ensure they understand legal ramifications of investigations, plan ahead for technical and non-technical issues, and make sure their equipment is ready anytime.
- Evaluation. This happens when a team is given information about an investigation. They assign roles and resources to the team, get details on facts and particulars about the case, and identify risks of the investigation.
- Collection. This involves the collection of evidence and learning about the cyber attack or cyber crime. Many tools and techniques are used to obtain this data, and can involve conducting interviews, obtaining the hard drives and other devices, and more. Devices are sealed in evidence bags to be further evaluated at the forensics lab.
- Analysis. This part of the investigation is vital to success. Evidence and data collected are analyzed to get as much information as possible about the breach or crime. This can involve who performed the crime, when it happened, what data was lost, digital evidence, and more. The analysis must be accurate, must be documented and recorded, it must be unbiased, and it must meet correct deadlines.
- Presentation. After analysis, the team presents a summary of its findings. They offer strategies to companies to help them increase their security and prevent issues in the future. A presentation will also be given to a court of law that needs details about the forensics evidence.
- Review. After the process is completed, the forensics team will do a review of how their investigation went, talk about things to improve in the future, and evaluate how to better serve in the next investigation.

##### Duties of a Cyber Forensics Expert in Their Day

- Conduct data breach investigations
- Recover and examine data from computers or electronics
