#### Overview

- NGINX revolutionized how servers operate in high-performance contexts and became the fastest web server available
- NGINX is an open-source software for:
  - Web serving
  - Reverse proxying
  - Caching
  - Load balancing
  - Media streaming
  - HTTP server capabilities:
    - Proxy server function for email (IMPA, POP3, and SMTP)
    - Reverse proxy and load balancer (HTTP, TCP, UDP servers)

#### What NGINX Can Do For You

- Frequently placed between clients and a second web server (serves as an SSL/TLS terminator or web application)
  - Helps with handling tasks that might slow down your web server to improve performance

- NGINX is:
  - A software-only, all-in-one load balancer, web server, API gateway, and reverse proxy designed for cloud-native architectures
  - A multi-funcation tool, minimizing the amount of toolings and configuration the organization needs to maintain
  - Evoloving to help lead the way on everything from HTTP/2 to microservices support
