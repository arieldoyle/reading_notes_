#### Site-to-Site VPN

- A site-to-site VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a connection set up between multiple networks
- Example: Corporate network where multiple offices work in conjuntion with a central office and multiple branch locations
- Useful for companies that prioritize private, protected traffic ("more secure, encrypted connection")
- First made possible through the use of the original packet switching network name ARPANET, as well as, the initial uses of TCP/IP
- A hidden IP address gives you the freedom to download torrents without revealing who you are

#### Remote Access VPN

- Temporary connection set up between two or more users and central location
- Useful tools for companies with remote workers either on the roas or in their homes

#### Intranet-based Site-to-Site

- connects more than one LAN to form a WAN
- Can setup to incorporate software-defined WAN (SD-WAN)
- Useful tools for combining resources housed in disparate offices securely, as if they were all in the same physical location

#### Extranet-based Site-to-Site

- Used by two or more different companies that want to share certain resources but keep other private
- Collaboration without sharing everything (proprietary data)

### Creating an Internet-based Site-to-Site VPN

- Three main components:
  - A base network in one location
  - A satellite network in another location
  - A tunnel with security gateways on each end

#### Why Implement a Site-to-Site VPN

- Considerations:
  - Number of locations
  - Business size
  - The distance between each location
  - The resources the locations have to share with each other

- 5 Key Components of Site-to-Site VPN
  - Watertight Security
  - Ease of Operations
  - Simple and Secure Scalability
  - Business Continuity
  - Flexible Deployment
